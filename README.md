# Requirements for the React test

- Try to reproduce the given design. It does not have to be perfect, the design itself has minor mistakes too.

- Use React as a frontend system.

- Functional requirements:
  - Create a listing page
  - Hovering over the ? should show a bit if info (example on one of the screens)
  - "Add to Cart" button should work and on every item
  - Cart to display the amount of items in it
  - Cart should have an show/hide feature on click

- What is not required:
  - Removing from the cart
  - Checkout button (but if it leads to a different page its a plus)
  - You can use your own assets/items, you don't have to use the give phone assets
